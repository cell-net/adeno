# adeno

This is the repo for the Adeno token.

This token was developed using the Foundry toolkit, which can be found at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry.

Once you have Foundry installed, clone the adeno repo, and navigate to the `adeno` directory.

In order to run the tests, run `forge test --fork-url x`, where x is the url of your Ethereum mainnet node. This can, for example, be an infura or alchemy url.

The above command will first compile the contracts and should install any missing dependencies, before running the tests.
